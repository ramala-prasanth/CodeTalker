This is the readme file for CodeTalker project.
What is the project about?
Imagine a world where digital characters can truly come alive--reacting, expressing, and speaking just like humans. This technology takes spoken words and seamlessly transforms them into lifelike facial expressions and movements on a 3D model. Whether it’s a character in a video game or an avatar in a virtual meeting, this system makes faces look more real and emotions more believable. It’s not just about lip-syncing; it’s about capturing the natural essence of human communication. To show how this technology creates more human-like digital characters, making them more expressive, relatable, and realistic across various platforms—from games and virtual assistants to social and immersive experiences.


Please refer to the Google Colab file for execution.
Start by running all the cells. when hosting the model, you will have to first create an account in ngrok (a website which allows to host api for free) https://ngrok.com/. 
After registering the account, copy your authentication token shown in the dashboard. 
in the colab notebook file, paste your auth token in the cell which asks you to do so. 
The webpage made out of streamlit will then be visible when you click the link generated.
